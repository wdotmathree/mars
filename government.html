      <h1 class="subtitle">Levels of Government</h1>
      <p class="description">
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;There are 2 levels of government, one that applies to the whole colony and one that is more local and
        specific to an area. The higher level of government will be similar to a federal government and will be responsible for
        things that concern the entire colony, such as maintaining a survivable environment and management of essential
        resources. The lower level will be similar to a municipal government and will be responsible for things that are
        specific to certain areas of the colony, such as management of local resources or recreational areas.
      </p>
      <h1 class="subtitle">Branches of Government</h1>
      <p class="description">
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The branches of government will be similar to that of the Canadian government. The judicial branch
        will be seperate from the other 2 so as to not include bias in legal cases and the other two will work together to
        create laws. The executive branch is responsible for proposing laws and putting them into effect while the legislative
        branch is responsible for debating and passing laws that were proposed by the executive branch.
      </p>
      <h1 class="subtitle">How are members of the legislative branch chosen?</h1>
      <p class="description">
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The members of the legislative branch will be chosen by election using an instant runoff voting
        method. Each citizen will vote for a representative for their region, which are determined by population. As it can be
        assumed that population spread on mars will be kept mostly uniform, representation by population is a lot less biased
        than that of places like Canada and will be a decent way to split the colony into regions.
      </p>
      <h1 class="subtitle">How are members of the executive branch chosen?</h1>
      <p class="description">
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Each citizen will get 2 votes in every election. One for their representative and one for the leader.
        The other members of the executive branch will either be voted for in the House of Commons or appointed by the elected
        leader.
      </p>
      <h1 class="subtitle">How will political parties work in the colony?</h1>
      <p class="description">
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Candidates can choose to either run independently or as part of a political party. There will be no
        requirement of party solidarity (members of political parties have to vote the same way) and the members will instead
        be allowed to vote based on what the citizens of their region believe. This allows us to keep some of the benefits of
        political parties while removing some of the drawbacks. Some of the benefits include better known candidates (due to
        them being tied to a well known party name) and potential funding from the party. One of the drawbacks mitigated by
        taking this hybrid approach is the elected representative not representing the citizens’ beliefs but instead
        representing the beliefs of the party due to party solidarity forcing them to vote in the party’s favor. This however,
        causes some issues of its own, including possble diminishing number of political parties as party solidarity is a main
        motivator for forming political parties in the first place.
      </p>
      <h1 class="subtitle">What control does the government have on media?</h1>
      <p class="description">
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;There will be minimal government control over media, except for publication restrictions on youth
        offenders or intentionally misleading information. An individual also will have the right to require that a media
        company remove false or unnecessary defamatory content, providing that the information is pertaining to the individual,
        except in cases where the publication is relating to the criminal or civil liability of which the individual is facing
        and the information is not otherwise protected.
      </p>
      <h1 class="subtitle">How will lobby groups work the colony?</h1>
      <p class="description">
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Lobby groups are run by citizens who want to influence their government. Citizens have the
        opportunity to arrange meetings with politicians but every communication they have must be documented. This reduces the
        likelihood of things such as bribery or manipulation occurring behind the citizens’ backs.
