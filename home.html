      <h1 class="subtitle">Interview with Colony Director</h1>
      <p class="description">
        Interviewer: Welcome back to channel 177013 news. Today we have a special guest. The director of the newly established
        Mars colony!<br /><br />Director: It’s a pleasure to be here today.<br /><br />Interviewer: Today I will be asking you
        some questions about the Mars colony if you don’t mind answering them.<br /><br />Director: Ask as you wish.<br /><br />Interviewer:
        How will you make sure the citizens have good access to resources?<br /><br />Director: We are partnering with Epcor to
        ensure we have a reliable supply of water and electricity. As well, we have good business relations with SpaceY who
        will transport people and resources safely to and from Mars.<br /><br />Interviewer: I’m sure the citizens of your
        colony will have a great experience. How will you ensure the safety of the people in the colony?<br /><br />Director:
        We have the latest technology in our survival domes and we use Atmel chips to control the conditions of the domes and
        the airlocks. They have been proven the produce most reliable and consistent chips so we have decided to go with
        them.<br /><br />Interviewer: Where did you do this testing?<br /><br />Director: We partnered with NASA in order to
        perform testing in a chamber made to simulate conditions on Mars. They have been great business partners so far and
        have done a great job simulating the conditions. We decided to go with them as the closer the testing conditions to the
        actual conditions, the safer it is.<br /><br />Interviewer: Those are all the questions I had. Thank you for your time
        today.

      <h1 class="subtitle">The horror of disposable chopsticks</h1>
      <p class="description">
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Disposable chopsticks are causing more of a problem than you might think. They are responsible for 4
        million trees being cut down from Asian forests every year. They are also treated with chemicals that cause respiratory
        disorders. As well, there are issues with labor and working conditions as they have been reportedly produced in labor
        camps, which are places where people are captured and forced to work in terrible working conditions. There should be
        regulations in place to prevent the unethical work but my guess (based on my reading of the article about labor camps)
        is that it would not affect much as the labor camps look as if they are at least supported if not run by the
        government. But if there is a way to prevent these labor camps from running, that would increase price of labor which
        would increase price of the product, thereby decreasing demand. With decreased demand, it would mean less production
        which will help with the environment. This would not be sustainable on the Mars colony as we do not have many resources
        in the first place and doing things like this will exhaust the limited resouces very quickly. As well, we want to keep
        the citizens of the colony as healthy as possible and labor camps will harm both the physical and mental health of the
        citizens involved. On the Mars colony, we must find an alternative for these products, such as encouraging customers to
        bring their own reusable chopsticks instead of providing them with dispoable ones.

      <h1 class="subtitle">Explanation for ad 1</h1>
      <p class="description">
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;In the first ad I incorporated the techniques of a testimonial, glittering generalities, rewards, and
        bandwagon. I included a testimonial by Kim Namjoon and put his positive words into a quote onto the advertisement. The
        ad utilized glittering generalizations in the sections where it was listing off things like “Simple Flights for
        Everyone”, “Safest way to Mars”, “Max comfort”, or “Unique experience”. These parts do not describe in very much detail
        the trip but makes the reader feel good about it. The parts with “Food and Drinks included” and “Travel insurance
        included” are forms of the advertising strategy rewards where the consumer is given rewards for consuming the product
        (in this case free food and drinks and travel insurance). The bandwagon effect is utilized by this ad where it says
        “Join thousands of satisfied customers”. This leads the reader to believe that they will be left out if they do not buy
        the product while also assuring them that the product has been tested by thousands of people and is deemed to be
        “good”.
      </p>
      <h1 class="subtitle">Explanation for ad 2</h1>
      <p class="description">
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;In the second ad I incorporated much fewer techniques. I mostly focused on glittering generalities
        and a little bit on emotional appeal and rewards. Most of the focus was placed on glittering generalities. The ad is
        very brief and does not contain much information about the product. The ad is advertising a tour of the Vunineont Dome
        but barely mentions anything about the tour other than time. The ad also included many images describing the modernity
        and luxury of the Dome but nothing like cost of living there. There can also be a relatively weak argument that the
        advertisement includes a bit of emotional appeal where urgency is induced in the reader by the date (which can be
        assumed to be close to the present date). Also, the word “free” in “free tour” may fall under the category of rewards.
        It may make the reader feel that they are not expending anything by attending the tour but can gain an experience by
        visiting the dome.
