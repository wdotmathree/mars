      <h1 class="subtitle">What type of economy will the colony have?</h1>
      <p class="description">
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The economy will have a mixed economy. One that is between market and planned economies. It will
        include aspects of both types of economies and intends to take the pros of both while minimizing cons. An example of a
        country using this type of economic system is Canada.
      </p>
      <h1 class="subtitle">3 basic economic questions</h1>
      <p class="description">
        What is produced: What will be produced is determined mostly by consumer demand but the government has some power as
        well.<br />Who does the producing: Most production will be done by privately owned businesses but there will also be
        some government owned (crown) / publically owned corporations that will provide some production.<br />Who gets the
        produced goods: Some goods and services will be available to anyone but others will be purchasable at a price set by
        the corporation providing them.
      </p>
      <h1 class="subtitle">How does this best deal with scarcity?</h1>
      <p class="description">
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;It provides essential services to all people to ensure people do not get left behind while still
        giving people an incentive to work harder by offering additional services.
      </p>
      <h1 class="subtitle">What government intervention will there be?</h1>
      <p class="description">
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The government will fund essential services such as healthcare and provide essential resources such
        as food and water to citizens. The government will only provide a minimum and additional can be purchased by the
        citizen.
      </p>
      <h1 class="subtitle">Is the government more left-wing or right-wing?</h1>
      <p class="description">
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The government is more left-wing as it provides essential services to all people which lines up
        almost perfectly with the definition of collectivism. The government cares about the collective good more than the
        individual.
      </p>
      <h1 class="subtitle">What is the role of labor unions?</h1>
      <p class="description">
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Labor unions protect worker rights by collective bargaining with the employer. They pressure the
        employer and can also go on strike which is when the employees refuse to go to work.
      </p>
      <h1 class="subtitle">How will the government tax citizens?</h1>
      <p class="description">
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The government will tax citizens based on percentage of income. There will also be tax brackets,
        where there are ranges of income which will be taxed the same percentage. The more the income, the more they will be
        taxed. In other words, tax the rich.
