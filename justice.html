      <p class="description">
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; The criminal justice system will be focused on getting the right combination of rehabilitation and
        retribution in order to maximize the pros of both while minimizing the cons. When a person is caught doing a crime they
        will be sent to court (based on severity and repeat offences). The officer may decide to use extrajudicial measures
        instead of sending the offender to court for minor and non-repeat offences which decreases load on the court system.
        When the offender gets to court, they will be judged by an unbiased judge and a jury which will be composed of regular
        citizens of various backgrounds. Using a (not so) carefully calculated statistic, it can be shown that there will only
        be about 25 court cases per day across the entire colony. So as long as the systems are designed with that in mind,
        they will not be overloaded. However, in the case where the court systems cannot be built to handle the load, more
        resources will be dedicated to rehabilitating youth offenders while the court may have to resort to a more retribution
        focused approach. This is because rehabilitating youth offenders has been shown to be more effective than adult
        offenders so the resources are better used there. This should only be used as a last resort however as a combination of
        rehabilitation and retribution is better than only one or the other in all cases.
