      <h1 class="subtitle">Classes of Immigrants</h1>
      <p class="description">
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;There will be 4 classes of immigrants, economic class, family class, refugees, and other reasons.
        Economic class immigrants will be considered based on a set of qualifications, including, education, language skills,
        work experience, age, arranged employment, adaptability, and Canadian citizenship. There will be a points system
        considering all these factors and their weights and compile them all into a single number. People with enough points
        will be allowed into the colony based on a cutoff value designed to qualify a specific amount of people (for example
        top 2000 people will qualify). Family class immigrants are family members of people who are already in the colony. The
        family members will automatically be granted citizenship once the person has been on the colony for a specified amount
        of time. This will allow families to be together without overloading the system by having everyone bring their family
        as soon as they arrive on Mars. The colony will accept refugees from other colonies on Mars which have become
        uninhabitable or if the people are being pursecuted for some reason. Refugees from other countries on Earth will
        instead go to Canada and a portion may be given the opportunity to come to Mars. Other people may be considered on a
        case by case basis if they do not fit any of the other 3 categories.
      </p>
      <h1 class="subtitle">How many of each type of immigrant will be accepted?</h1>
      <p class="description">
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The distribution of immigrants accepted will be flexible but should be kept somewhat close to 70%
        economic, 25% family class, and 5% for both refugees and other reasons. The distribution should be kept somewhat close
        to that by modifying the cutoff for economic immigrants. There will not be a mandate on number of immigrants accepted.
      </p>
      <h1 class="subtitle">What requirements are there for becoming a citizen?</h1>
      <p class="description">
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;You can be a citizen if you were accepted as an immigrant or if you were part of the original 1
        million people of the colony. If you decide to leave the colony, you retain your citizenship and only citizens are
        allowed at the colony. All potential citizens will then be educated then tested on the matters of the colony and will
        only be granted citizenship if they pass.
      </p>
      <h1 class="subtitle">What financial support will be offered to immigrants</h1>
      <p class="description">
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Economic class and family class immigrants will be offerered the same financial support as normal
        citizens of the colony. The reasoning is that economic class immigrants most likely need less financial support and
        financial support is still offered to them (like standard low income benefits). By doing so, more support can be given
        to those who need more support, such as refugees.
